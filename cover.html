    <div class="greeting">DNI,</div>
    <div class="body-text">
      <p>I am excited to apply for the Support Technician I position at NEXCOM. I have been looking to transition my career to something I am more passionate about, and I’m ready to take the next step in that direction.</p>
      <p>I bring a CompTIA Security+ certification and a year of IT Helpdesk experience at the University of Colorado, where I built a strong foundation in troubleshooting, customer support, documentation, and supporting users in a production environment. In parallel, I have developed several years of hands-on experience through extensive IT projects in my personal Home Lab, where I design, implement, document, and maintain systems that mirror real-world enterprise environments. I operate a Proxmox hypervisor hosting multiple Linux and Windows virtual machines for services, testing, and isolated lab environments, supported by containerized applications using Docker and Docker Compose. My lab includes centralized logging and monitoring, configuration management and automation, Active Directory with DNS and DHCP, secure remote access, backup and recovery solutions, and hardened network services. This experience has strengthened my ability to analyze system behavior, manage change, document configurations, and troubleshoot issues across interconnected systems, while always considering security, reliability, and scalability in support of operational and business needs.</p>

      <p>
What drives me most is a desire to expand my knowledge of IT systems and figure out better solutions to implement in my career and personal life. I love figuring out how systems work and diving into new challenges. I’m always working to build my skills further through certifications and coursework, and I know that mix of passion, experience, and drive will make me a valuable addition to your team.
      </p>
      <P>I have no doubt that my contributions will help ensure that projects and operations run smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, my ability to work well under pressure and multitask effectively will enable me to handle the demands of a fast-paced IT environment. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications with you further. Feel free to contact me via email or SMS. I can also be found on the third floor, Nimitz Merchandiser pod .
