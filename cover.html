      I am excited to apply for the application administrator position at NEXCOM. I have been with NEXCOM since February of 2025 as a merchandiser. I love my position as a merchandiser. I am in the consumer technology division and do merchandising for computers and wearables. However, I am looking to grow my career and transition into something I am more passionate for, which is IT. I have a CompTIA Security+ certification and year of IT helpdesk experience from working at the university of Colorado. On top of this work experience, I have years of experience at home learning through my Home Lab. I have an Ubuntu home server running different docker containers for various purposes. My server runs a fully redundant raid-1 array with various VM's and servers and I operate it all using SSH. I have a vast knowledge base of IT related projects and troubleshooting. Anything I don't know I am very interested in learning and figuring out how different system works. I am constantly looking to grow my resum√® with different courses and certifications. With this knowledge and qualification I know I will be highly valuable to your team.<br><br>
      I may not have a degree in an IT related field as other candidates may have. However I do have the passion and skills necessarry to excel in this position. I have no doubt that my contribution will help ensure that projects and operations run smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, my ability to work well under pressure and to multitask effectively will enable me to handle the demands of a fast-paced IT environment. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications with you further. Feel free to contact me via email or sms message. Additionally, I am located on the third floor in the Nimitz merchandising pod.
