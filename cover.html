      <p>I am excited to apply for the Client Services Technician position at NEXCOM. I have been looking to transition my career to something I am more passionate about, and I’m ready to take the next step in that direction.</p>
      <p>I hold a CompTIA Security+ certification and have one year of IT Helpdesk experience at the University of Colorado, where I established a strong foundation in troubleshooting, customer support, documentation, and supporting users in a production environment. Additionally, I possess several years of hands-on experience through self-directed IT projects that closely mirror real-world enterprise environments. I manage a Proxmox-based lab hosting Linux and Windows virtual machines for isolated testing, services, and operational use, including Active Directory with DNS and DHCP, centralized logging and monitoring, automation scripts, secure remote access, backup and recovery solutions, and hardened security practices. This experience has strengthened my ability to analyze system behavior, manage change, document configurations, and troubleshoot complex, interconnected systems while maintaining a strong focus on security, reliability, and scalability in support of organizational objectives.</p>

      <p>
        What drives me most is a desire to expand my knowledge of IT systems and implement better solutions to improve my career and personal life. I love exploring how systems work and diving into new challenges and projects. I'm always working to build my skills further through certifications and coursework, and I know that mix of passion, experience, and drive will make me a valuable addition to your team.
      </p>
      <P>I have no doubt that my contributions will help ensure that projects and operations run smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, my ability to work well under pressure and multitask effectively will enable me to handle the demands of a fast-paced IT environment. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications with you further. Feel free to contact me via email or SMS. I can also be found on the third floor, Nimitz Merchandiser pod.

      </P>
