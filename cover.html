      <p>I am excited to apply for the System Network Administrator position at Langley AFB. I am have been looking to transition my career to something I am more passionate for, and I’m ready to take the next step in that direction.</p>

      <p>I bring a CompTIA Security+ certification and a year of IT Helpdesk experience from the University of Colorado, where I built a strong foundation in troubleshooting and customer support. Outside of work, I’ve spent years learning and experimenting in my own Home Lab. I run an Ubuntu server with Docker containers, a RAID-1 array working as a NAS, as well as a ProxMox hypervisor running various windows and linux based VMs, all managed through SSH with no gui. Through my homelabbing journey I have hands on experience with Linux and Windows server administration, networking, contanerization, security, monitoring, and automation. That hands-on experience has taught me how to solve problems quickly and given me a wide range of IT knowledge.</p>

      <p>What drives me most is a want to expand my kowledge of IT systems and figuring out better solutions to implement in my career and personal life. I love figuring out how systems work and diving into new challenges. I’m always working to build my skills further through certifications and coursework, and I know that mix of passion, experience, and drive will make me a valuable addition to your team.

      </p>
      <P>I have no doubt that my contribution will help ensure that projects and operations run smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, my ability to work well under pressure and to multitask effectively will enable me to handle the demands of a fast-paced IT environment. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications with you further. Feel free to contact me via email or sms message.</P>
